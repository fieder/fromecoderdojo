# Rule #1
This is a safe and friendly environment open to everyone who wants to learn. It does not matter where do you come from, if you are a girl or a boy, rich or poor. Just **be cool**, that's the only rule.

# Have fun with us
We want to take you on a learning journey to explore some of the cool stuff you can build on the internet

```js
// This is what we do
if ( you.cool() == true ) {
	console.log('awesome keep it that way')
	//Come and join us
	writeUsAnEmailTo('fromecoderdojo@gmail.com')
	//we'll improve your knowledge
	you.knowledge( coding++ );
	//and send you back home :)
	return you;
} else {
	//you miss out !
	return -1
}
```
