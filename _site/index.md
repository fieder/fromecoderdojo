# Be cool, the only rule
This is an safe and friendly environment open to everyone who wants to learn. It does not matter where do you come from, if you are a girl or a boy, rich or poor, or if you believe in god or practice any religion. Be cool, that's the only rule to be part of this community.

## Have fun with us
We want to take you on a learning journey to explore some of the cool stuff you can build on the internet
